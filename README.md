Clarification

I would not write this crawler in a real environment, I would just probably use
https://github.com/yasserg/crawler4j or something similar.

I am assuming you want me to wrote some code, so I will write the crawler code
but I will use jsoup to help me with that.

To build the project run:

mvn clean install

To run the web crawler run:

mvn clean install
cd target
unzip release.zip
